# Connecting Python with DB

This class will allow our python to easily connect with our DB.

To do so, we will use a package called PYODBC.

This package abstracts our connections to the DB.

# PYODBC and OOP

We are looking into the PYODBC package.

And we are going to use the package to make a OOP module, that abstracts our interaction with the NW Database.

And then further abstract the interaction with specific Tables.

Finally, where appropriate we will use the CRUD design to build methods. 


## CRUD

### CREATE -

### READ -

#### - READ ONE

#### - READ ALL

### UPDATE -

### DELETE -
